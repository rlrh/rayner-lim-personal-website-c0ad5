This was a CS2103T Software Engineering group project, and I was the team lead and the developer for the reader view feature as well as overall UI/UX designer.

As the team lead I was mainly responsible for idea generation, product definition, project planning and documentation, and as a developer I also contributed to software architecture and design, code review, and third-party dependency integration.
