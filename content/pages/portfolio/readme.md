#### [GitHub](https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-1/main)

> Offline-first integrated bookmark manager and feed aggregator JavaFX desktop application for subscribing to web feeds and saving web pages to read later.

This was a CS2103T Software Engineering group project which involved building upon an existing brownfield project, and I was the team lead and the developer for the reader view feature as well as overall UI/UX designer.

As the team lead I was mainly responsible for idea generation, product definition, project planning and documentation, and as a developer I also contributed to software architecture and design, code review, and third-party dependency integration.

README helps you discover, organize and read more content you care about anywhere you go.

*   **All-in-one:** Follow web feeds and bookmark web pages - save interesting articles, cooking recipes, song lyrics, or anything else you come across while browsing.

*   **Read Anywhere:** Read offline, anywhere and anytime you want - all the links you save are downloaded onto your personal computer so youâ€™ll never lose them.

*   **Stay Focused:** Consume more content more comfortably - reading view strips away visual clutter to create a distraction-free reading experience so you can focus on content.

*   **Keep Organized:** Curate your content - organize and categorize your feeds and links and find them quickly with powerful search, sort and filter functionality.

*   **Fast:** Never leave your keyboard - single-shot commands and keyboard shortcuts let you do more in less time.
