> Electronic exam marking software, successfully deployed in NUS to mark CS1010S exams with hundreds of students and multiple markers, as well as CS2040S, CS3203, CS4218 exams.

Working as a frontend developer in a team of 3 engineers and 1 designer under the direction of Prof. Ben Leong, I was mainly responsible for the core viewing, marking and annotation functionality built with React Konva, as well as working with the UX/UI designer to translate mockups into React components.

Built as a responsive web app with an Express/Node backend API and React/Material-UI frontend with extensive use of TypeScript.
