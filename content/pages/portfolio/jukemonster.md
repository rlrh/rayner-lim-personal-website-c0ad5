#### [Live demo](https://www.juke.monster/)

> Jukemonster is a social jukebox for Spotify where party guests can add and vote songs in real time.

I was the lead frontend designer and developer in a team of 4 engineers (2 backend and 2 frontend), and this was our mobile cloud application project for the module CS3216 Software Product Engineering for Digital Markets.

The frontend is built as a progressive web application (PWA) using React with extensive use of Hooks and Ionic Framework for responsive design, while the backend is built with Django and Django Channels for WebSockets real-time communication.
